# Object Detection

## Introduction
Apply your new knowledge of CNNs to one of the hottest (and most challenging!) fields in computer vision: object detection.

## Learning Objectives

* Identify the components used for object detection (landmark, anchor, bounding box, grid, ...) and their purpose
* Implement object detection
* Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy
* Implement intersection over union
* Handle bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning
* Apply sparse categorical crossentropy for pixelwise prediction
* Implement semantic image segmentation on the CARLA self-driving car dataset
* Explain the difference between a regular CNN and a U-net
* Build a U-Net
