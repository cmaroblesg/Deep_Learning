# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks
Implement the foundational layers of CNNs (pooling, convolutions) and stack them properly in a deep network to solve multi-class image classification problems.

## Learning Objectives
* Explain the convolution operation
* Apply two different types of pooling operations
* Identify the components used in a convolutional neural network (padding, stride, filter, ...) and their purpose
* Build a convolutional neural network
* Implement convolutional and pooling layers in numpy, including forward propagation
* Implement helper functions to use when implementing a TensorFlow model
* Create a mood classifer using the TF Keras Sequential API
* Build a ConvNet to identify sign language digits using the TF Keras Functional API
* Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a binary classification problem
* Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a multiclass classification problem
* Explain different use cases for the Sequential and Functional APIs
