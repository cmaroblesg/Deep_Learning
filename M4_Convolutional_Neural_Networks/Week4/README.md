# Special Applications: Face recognition & Neural Style Transfer

## Introduction
Explore how CNNs can be applied to multiple fields, including art generation and face recognition, then implement your own algorithm to generate art and recognize faces!

## Learning Objectives
* Differentiate between face recognition and face verification
* Implement one-shot learning to solve a face recognition problem
* Apply the triplet loss function to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition
* Explain how to pose face recognition as a binary classification problem
* Map face images into 128-dimensional encodings using a pretrained model
* Perform face verification and face recognition with these encodings
* Implement the Neural Style Transfer algorithm
* Generate novel artistic images using Neural Style Transfer
* Define the style cost function for Neural Style Transfer
* Define the content cost function for Neural Style Transfer
