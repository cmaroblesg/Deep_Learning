# Deep Convolutional Models: Case Studies
## Introduction
Discover some powerful practical tricks and methods used in deep CNNs, straight from the research papers, then apply transfer learning to your own deep CNN.

## Learning Objectives
* Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets in a deep neural network using Keras
* Train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification
* Implement a skip connection in your network
* Create a dataset from a directory
* Preprocess and augment data using the Keras Sequential API
* Adapt a pretrained model to new data and train a classifier using the Functional API and MobileNet
* Fine-tine a classifier's final layers to improve accuracy
