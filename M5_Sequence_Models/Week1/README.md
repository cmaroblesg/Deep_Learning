# Recurrent Neural Networks

## Introduction
Discover recurrent neural networks, a type of model that performs extremely well on temporal data, and several of its variants, including LSTMs, GRUs and Bidirectional RNNs.

## Learning Objectives
* Define notation for building sequence models
* Describe the architecture of a basic RNN
* Identify the main components of an LSTM
* Implement backpropagation through time for a basic RNN and an LSTM
* Give examples of several types of RNN
* Build a character-level text generation model using an RNN
* Store text data for processing using an RNN
* Sample novel sequences in an RNN
* Explain the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in RNNs
* Apply gradient clipping as a solution for exploding gradients
* Describe the architecture of a GRU
* Use a bidirectional RNN to take information from two points of a sequence
* Stack multiple RNNs on top of each other to create a deep RNN
* Use the flexible Functional API to create complex models
* Generate your own jazz music with deep learning
* Apply an LSTM to a music generation task
