# Sequence Models & Attention Mechanism

## Introduction
Augment your sequence models using an attention mechanism, an algorithm that helps your model decide where to focus its attention given a sequence of inputs. Then, explore speech recognition and how to deal with audio data.

## Learning Objectives
* Describe a basic sequence-to-sequence model
* Compare and contrast several different algorithms for language translation
* Optimize beam search and analyze it for errors
* Use beam search to identify likely translations
* Apply BLEU score to machine-translated text
* Implement an attention model
* Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions
* Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets
* Structure a speech recognition project

* [Trigger Word Detection](./codes/Trigger_word_detection_v2a.ipynb)
