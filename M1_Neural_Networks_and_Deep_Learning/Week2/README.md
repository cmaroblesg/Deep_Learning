# Neural Networks Basics
## Introduction
Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models.

## Learning Objectives
* Build a logistic regression model structured as a shallow neural network.
* Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including parameter initialization, cost function and gradient calculation, and optimization implementation (gradient descent).
* Implement computationally efficient and highly vectorized versions of models.
* Compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset.
* Use Numpy functions and Numpy matrix/vector operations.
* Work with iPython Notebooks.
* Implement vectorization across multiple training examples.
