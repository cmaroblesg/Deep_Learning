# Hyperparameter Tuning, Batch Normalization and Programming Frameworks

## Introduction
Explore TensorFlow, a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks quickly and easily, then train a neural network on a TensorFlow dataset.

## Learning Objectives
* Master the process of hyperparameter tuning
* Describe softmax classification for multiple classes
* Apply batch normalization to make your neural network more robust
* Build a neural network in TensorFlow and train it on a TensorFlow dataset
* Describe the purpose and operation of GradientTape
* Use tf.Variable to modify the state of a variable
* Apply TensorFlow decorators to speed up code
* Explain the difference between a variable and a constant

## Programming Assignment
* [TensorFlow Basic Structure](./codes/TensorFlow_BasicStructure.ipynb)
* [TensorFlow Introduction](./codes/Tensorflow_introduction.ipynb)
